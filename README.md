# GraphRecursiveQueries
This repository contains samples for graph transitive closure or shortest path type queries

For these scripts to work, you will have to restore WideWorldImporters database backup from here: https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/wide-world-importers-v1.0/WideWorldImporters-Full.bak, then run:
1.	Setup-wwi-graph.sql – to setup the graph database
2.	Run GraphQueries-wwi.sql to run the recommendation engine query and shortest path queries.
